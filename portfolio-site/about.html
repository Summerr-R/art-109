    <p>I am currently a junior at San Jose State University, studying graphic design with a minor in interaction design (IXD). My goal is to blend creative exploration with a strong focus on user experience. Over the past three years I’ve gained both academic and real-world experience as a designer, creating for both hypothetical and real clients.
        I’ve always been an artist, starting with more traditional media like sketching and painting. Over time, I’ve embraced the digital world, exploring new tools and techniques that offer greater versatility and depth. I strive to push boundaries and challenge myself with new ideas and concepts. For me, design is more than just a skill—it’s a way to express complex ideas and emotions. I craft each of my pieces to be more intricate and impactful.
        While most of my work has been independent, which has allowed me to explore my own style and creative vision, I have also gained experience. There, I created impactful posters, eye-catching advertisements, and carefully crafted logos. This experience has expanded my skill set, teaching me how to implement my creativity with my client’s expectations.
